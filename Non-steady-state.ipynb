    "## Defining a model\n",
    "We now define the model in several steps. First the simulation is defined with the command flopy.mf6.MFSimulation(). This command requires the parameters simulation name and simulation workspace sim_name and sim_ws. The character string is already produced in the variable \"workspace\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tdis\n",
    "Second, the temporal discretization is defined using the command flopy.mf6.ModflowTdis(). This command requires 3 parameters: the simulation \"sim\", which is an object that we have just defined in the previous line, the number of periods \"nper\", in this case 10. If the variable is nper=1 it is a steady state model, if the variable is > 1, it is a non-steady model. Third, we need the periodical data. We produce 10 arrays with the index 0 to 9 using the loop for _ in range(10). Each time an array of 365 to 1 is produced with the step=1, because of range(start,stop,step). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ims\n",
    "The command flopy.mf6.ModflowIms is the class used to define the IMS (Iterative Model Solution) package for MODFLOW 6. The IMS package controls how the numerical solver works — including convergence criteria, iteration limits, and solver method parameters. Here we use the default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gwf\n",
    "With the command flopy.mf6.ModflowGwf we create an single instance of the groundwater flow model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dis\n",
    "With flopy.mf6.ModflowGwfdis(gwf, nlay=3, nrow=4, ncol=5, top=50.0, botm=botm) we define the spatial discretization of the model. It must have as a first parameter the variable \"gwf\" (which is our model instance), then it has the number of layers and rows and columns and you can specificy a real value for the top (which is always in meters). The default value for botm is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fic\n",
    "With the command flopy.mf6.ModflowGwffic, the model is initialized. A variable strt ([double]) must be specified, which is the  initial (starting) head—that. This is the head at the beginning of the GWF Model simulation. STRT must be specified for all simulations, including steady-state simulations. One value is read for every model cell. For simulations in which the first stress period is steady state, the values used for STRT generally do not affect the simulation (exceptions may occur if cells go dry and (or) rewet). The execution time, however, will be less if STRT includes hydraulic heads that are close to the steady-state solution. A head value lower than the cell bottom can be provided if a cell should start as dry. If it is not specified, it will be inititalized with strt=1.0.\n",

    "### NPF Node property flow package\n",

    "The Node Property Flow package is the package used to calculate flow between cells in MODFLOW 6. It is key. We also tell the program to save the specific discharge between cells: With flopy.mf6.ModflowGwfnpf(gwf, save_specific_discharge=True).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### CHD\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we use the CHD package in MODFLOW which is the Time-Variant Specified-Head Package. It is used to assign fixed hydraulic heads to specific cells in a groundwater model, where those heads can change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose\n",
    "Simulates boundary conditions where the hydraulic head is known and enforced. It is useful for modeling:\n",
    "- Constant head boundaries (e.g., ocean, large lakes, rivers with stable stage)\n",
    "- Time-varying heads (e.g., tidal effects, seasonal water level changes)\n",
    "- Transient simulations where head values change between stress periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "flopy.mf6.ModflowGwfchd(gwf, stress_period_data=[[(0, 0, 0), 1.0], [(2, 3, 4), 0.0]]). Here the boundary conditions are given for the different layers (as a vector (0,0,0) and (2,3,4) and for different values 1.0 and 0.0.\n",

    "### Defining where the files are written\n",
